![](/public/dinder-screenshot.png)

## Getting Started

### Installation
A facebook account is required to use Dinder. On the home page, click
to login, and you will be redirected to facebook to confirm login 
credentials.

### Instructions
Once logged in, you will arrive at the users page, where you can perform
Dinder searches or view past Dinder likes. To start a new Dinder search,
click on the link and input as many specified fields to search for (by 
default it will search for restaurants from your current location). Then 
choose to like or dislike the search results to narrow down what
restaurants will be displayed to you on your liked page. After performing
multiple searches, you can view your likes in the liked page where you
edit the returned yelp businesses (üëç or üëé )

### MVP
-Oauth login (facebook)
-Creates JSON (based off of a user's yelp api call) 
-Mongoose to CRUD user data
-Data rendered as interacatable cards
-Deployed online using Heroku

### General Approach
For this project sprint, we closely followed Agile Deployment methods
to brainstorm, create a back log, work on the top things of the back log, 
then repeat the whole process again. We spent the first day wireframing,
writing user stories and creating routes/data schemas. After the GitHub 
and waffleboard were created and configured, we followed scrum methodology
to push up our code once an hour and have stand ups twice a day. All major 
concerns and blockers were addressed during the group stand up then solved 
during the group discussion that followed.

### Unsolved Problems
* User doesn't allow location
* Repeating entries for businesses in database
* Swiping on android phones

### Additional Features
* Place lat,long on google maps for results
* Editable comments in dropdown
* Bookmarking in Yelp
* Sharable Results
